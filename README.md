# Beauty Vault

## Introduction and Motivation
This website is for the second project of my Software Engineering bootcamp at Per Scholas.

I chose to create a website for a makeup store because I enjoy the simple look of makeup websites like Rare Beauty and Makeup Geek.

### Update Route (URL: /meals/:id)
Clicking the Buy button will update the meal's quantity by decrementing it by 1. It also redirects the user to the meal's show page which will now display the updated quantity. 

If the quantity remaining is ever less than 1, a SOLD OUT text will replace the quantity on the show page, and the Buy button will be removed.
